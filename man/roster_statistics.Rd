\usage{
roster_statistics(
  team = 1,
  season = "now",
  game_type = "",
  position = "skaters"
)

}
\arguments{
\item{team}{integer ID (e.g., 21), character full name (e.g., 'Colorado
Avalanche'), OR three-letter code (e.g., 'COL'); see \code{\link[=teams]{teams()}} for
reference; ID is preferable as there now exists duplicate three-letter codes
(i.e., 'UTA' for 'Utah Hockey Club' and 'Utah Mammoth')}

\item{season}{integer in YYYYYYYY (e.g., 20242025); see \code{\link[=seasons]{seasons()}} for

= playoff/post-season) OR character of 'pre', 'regular', or
playoff'/'post'; see \code{\link[=seasons]{seasons()}} for reference; most functions will NOT
support pre-season}

\item{position}{character of 's'/'skaters' or 'g'/'goalies'}
